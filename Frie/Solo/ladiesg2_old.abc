%  Artist: Traditional
%  Mood: irish, bardy, 
%  
%  Playing multipart files:
%    /play <filename> <part> sync
%  example:
%  pippin does:  /play weargreen 2 sync
%  samwise does: /play weargreen 3 sync
%  pippin does:  /playstart
%  
%  If you want to play a solo piece, skip the sync and it will start without /playstart.
