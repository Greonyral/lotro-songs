Bruzo's Ghost Story


~ The sun set a while ago
~ and the moon was full tonight.
~ I stood on a field,
~ all by myself
~ a scare crow just over there.

~ "No time to be afraid,
~ there is nothing here 
~ that could hurt me!"
~ I thought by myself
~ "It's just a field 
~ and a puppet on a stick!"


~ But then I heard a voice.
~ "Bruzo my dear, come over here!"
~ I turned towards the scare crow
~ and there she was, waving to me!

~ "Bruzo come over here!
~ Don't be afraid, 
~ I wont hurt you.
~ I am so alone here
~ I really, really need your help!"

~ "Bruzo, dear, 
~ mate with me!
~ Our babies will keep me company,
~ I waited long 
~ for this opportunity
~ you're just the perfect hobbit for this!"

/flex

~ "Your face, your ears, your toes
~ you're the ugliest hobbit I've seen yet
~ Our babies will great at scaring all the birds away!
/sigh

~ Bruzo, get over here!
~ Don't be afraid 
~ it will be fun!
~ I am so alone here
~ I really, really need your help!"

~ ahhhhh


~ I ran home screaming and told Vratik the next day to go and check that field at full moon
