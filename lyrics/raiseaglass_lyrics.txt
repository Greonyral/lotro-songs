~It's funny how the brew's gone stale, much like our love did too
~Oh, my love, you know it's true, I'd rather drink than you

~You once were bubbly, full of life and cheer
~But now you're flat, it’s oh so clear
~I’ll raise a glass to days gone by
~And let this old love, like ale, run dry

~Your smile once sparkled, like the finest brew
~Now I sit and ponder, what became of you
~Our nights once filled with laughter, now just echoes in the hall
~I'd trade this fading memory for a pint that's not so dull

~You once were bubbly, full of life and cheer
~But now you're flat, it’s oh so clear
~I’ll raise a glass to days gone by
~And let this old love, like ale, run dry

~The fire’s warm, yet the air feels cold
~Your touch once thrilled, now it just feels old
~I’d rather have an ale than feel this empty chair
~Your laughter's just a whisper in the tavern’s noisy flair

~You once were bubbly, full of life and cheer
~But now you're flat, it’s oh so clear
~I’ll raise a glass to days gone by
~And let this old love, like ale, run dry

~You once were bubbly, full of life and cheer
~But now you're flat, it’s oh so clear
~I’ll raise a glass to days gone by
~And let this old love, like ale, run dry
