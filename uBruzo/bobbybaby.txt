Well, you know, 
all things have to end some day,
and eventually the bards will sing about the deeds of your life

Now .. 
I'm a little impatient 
so here is a song I imagine the bards might sing about me



~ There's a bump on the hill where your body lies.
~ There's a stone in the ground reads "This hobbit did try"
~ If you look to the east, you see an old stage
~ it's weathered and broken, like you in your end

~ Oh Bruzo, babe, we all know the truth
~ You were looking for love in all the bad that you do
~ Bruzo, baby, we all know the deal
~ Your row was hard and long and straight up a hill.

~ Your inspiration was gone
~ Your songs sounded wrong
~ Your audience ran away in disgust
~ Your band tried so long
~ but finally dropped
~ you were left with nothing at all
~ but your self doubts

~ Every once in awhile I still can see
~ Your bald head searching a way to be free
~ And I go to your grave, bottle in hand
~ And pour out your freedom right there in the sand

~ Oh Bruzo, babe, we all know the truth
~ You were looking for love in all the bad that you do
~ Bruzo, baby, we all know the deal
~ Your row was hard and long and straight up a hill.

/sigh

~ Your inspiration was gone
~ Your songs sounded wrong

~ Your band tried so long
